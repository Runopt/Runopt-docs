## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Project
1. Navigate to the [Homepage](https://core.runopt.co/home)

2. Click on the Start Real Estate Feasibility Analysis Button

![Homepage Real Estate Feasibility Analysis](/img/screenshots/core-product-realestate-feasibility-button.png)

3. Enter the project details
    - Enter project Name
    - Choose a zoning type from the dropdown menu
    - Click on the 'Add Project' Button.  

    ![Homepage Project Details](/img/screenshots/core-product-project-details.png)

4. A new project will be created and displayed under the 'All Projects' section of the Homepage. Click on the project card newly created(usually the first/last card displayed).

![Homepage All projects](/img/screenshots/core-product-all-projects.png)

### 2. Stage One: Building and Parking Lots placement
1. Once the project created is selected from the last step above,
    -  Import Site Data by clicking on the 'Import Existing Site' button under Data tab on the sidebar.

    ![Core product import data](/img/screenshots/core-product-import-data.png)

    -  Upload the Excel or CSV file.

    ![Core product Upload file](/img/screenshots/core-product-upload-csv-file.png)

    -  A terrain layer will be generated.

    ![Core product Upload file](/img/screenshots/core-product-terrain-layer.png)

    - Add building by clicking on the Buildings button on the sidebar. This will open the Buildings Panel.

    ![Core product Upload file](/img/screenshots/core-product-buildings-panel.png)

    - Click on the '+Add Building' button to draw the building footprint on the canvas. Enter the building name on the top of the canvas. Save Building at the bottom of the canvas.

    ![Core product Upload file](/img/screenshots/core-product-draw-building.png)


    - Once done, click the 'Submit the Building' button.

    - Next, click on the 'Parking' Button on the sidebar to open the Parking Specifications panel. Enter the number of parking lots. Save Specifications.

    ![Core product Upload file](/img/screenshots/core-product-add-parking.png)

    - Finally, under the Run tab on the sidebar, click on the 'Run Stage 1 - building placement' button for the first optimization. This will take a 1-2 mins. In the meantime, enjoy reading the fun buiding up process.

### 3. Stage Two: Drainage placement
#### The Geotechnical data part & the roadway module is still under development

#### Utilities 
For the utilities configuration section, you can enter the information based on the data we've provided in the illustration below.

-  Click on the 'Utilities button' on the sidebar. This will open up the Utilities Configuration Panel.

![Core product Upload file](/img/screenshots/core-product-utilities-configuration.png)

-  Under the Water Supply Node, Click on the 'select water supply node' text. This will enable you to select a node (x and y coordinate) on the interactive terrrain. Click on the terrain to select the node.The node x and y coordinate will then appear in the utilities configuration panel.

- Under the Wastewater Use Node click on the 'Select wasterwatr Node' text. This will enable you to select a node on the interactive terrain. Click on the terrain to select the node. The node x and y coordinate will then appear in the utilities configuration panel.

- Select the pipe material from the dropdown menu. 

- Enter the Frost Line Depth, if any.

- Enter the initial Flow Rate.

- Click on save configuration.

- Finally, under the Run tab on the sidebar, click on the 'Run Stage 2: Pipe Design' button for the first optimization. This will take a 1-2 mins to run the process and produce the pipe network optimization and cost. In the meantime, enjoy reading the fun buiding up process.

### 4. Stage Three: Stormwater

Now we can add the stormwater input specifications for the analysis.

- In the sidebar, under the Data tab, click on the 'Precip Data' button.  This will open the Stormwater Input Specifications' form.


![Core product Upload file](/img/screenshots/core-product-storm-water-specifications.png)

- Fill in the Storm Design Frequency.

- Fill in the Frost Line Depth.

- Enter the Minimum Pipe Slope.

- Click on the 'Save Specifications' button. 

- Finally, under the Run tab on the sidebar, click on the 'Run Stage 3: Storm Water Analysis' button for the first optimization. This will take a 1-2 mins to run the process and produce the pipe network optimization and cost. In the meantime, enjoy reading the fun buiding up process.
